# Linear-Equations
Solving an arbitrary system of n linear equations in n unknowns.
Java codes to compute the transpose, adjoint, and inverse of a matrix; the product of a matrix and a column vector; and the determinant of a matrix.
Hence using Martin's rule to solve the system by combining the codes.
